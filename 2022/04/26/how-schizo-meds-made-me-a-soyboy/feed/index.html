The main reason was that I had a lot of success with risperidone. But, as detailed in this post, was not ideal in the long-term. CBD was next up in the queue for me to try based on my research. If it didn&#039;t work, it&#039;s quite likely I may have tried Abilify/Aripiprazole.

Thank you for expressing your gratitude for my blogging. Comments like yours justify my continued writings as they come up (as well as continued hosting of this site) ‚ù§Ô∏è]]></description>

Hi Ian,

Thanks for the reply. I&#039;m recently diagnosed but haven&#039;t had that much of an issue with negative symptoms.  I weightlift as well.

You seemed to have tried a lot of medications, may I ask why you didn&#039;t try aripiprazole (abilify)? Seems to be one of the best tolerated AP on the market.
Anyway, thanks for the reply and the blog. Interesting reading üëç]]></description>

Hey Ben,

As far as negative symptoms go, weightlifting provides me a combination of overall better health which reduces negative symptoms, as well as a sort of &#039;boost&#039; of testosterone that I found is extremely effective for negative symptoms.

That said, the research I based this learning on does say it doesn&#039;t work for all men. Additionally, women were not in the study, so I don&#039;t know if it works for women. Anyway, here are some links:
https://ianrandmckenzie.com/2021/02/17/schizophrenia-lack-of-motivation-how-to-beat-it/
https://ianrandmckenzie.com/2021/02/08/natural-schizophrenia-antipsychotic-weight-lifting/

Those links are a couple of entry points, but I recommend reading all of the schizophrenia related posts I made in January and February of 2021.

Cheers,

Ian

edit: There&#039;s also this post that seems to be my most popular. I&#039;ve done a lot of learning since I wrote it, though. At the time, it was my silver bullet against schizophrenia. I couldn&#039;t fathom at the time that it was merely a baseline to be improved upon. Hah.

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting to read about your experiences with these different drugs. Glad you have found success with CBD oil and have moved off antipsychotics which can have some pretty rough side effects. Also, great to read about your weightlifting self help regime. What else have you found particularly helpful in dealing with negative symptoms? Maybe you could do a blog post about this. It would certainly help me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi. Sorry if the clickbait terminology is offputting. Many people who use the word soyboy are either young, rebellious, or under-educated ‚Äì or a combination of all three. This was very much me at various points in my life. I am using language that reaches these people because I sure as fuck would probably be better off I read something like this earlier in my life.

This isn&#039;t to say I have any regrets, but why not share what I know to give people a better starting point so that they don&#039;t have to figure it out themselves as I did?
