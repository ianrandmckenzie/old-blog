<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Note to the Reader</h2>



<p>This short story is a 10 to 20-minute read, and 20 to 30 minutes in spoken word if you are reading it out loud to yourself or someone else.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Story</h2>



<p>In the heart of a mystical forest, twilight cast its ethereal glow upon ancient trees adorned with twinkling fairy lights. Playful, glowing faeries danced around a crystal-clear pond as their wings shimmered in the fading light. A cozy, ivy-covered stone cottage peered from between the trees, holding secrets and wonder within its walls. Hidden among the magical landscape, a diligent mushroom nymph named Mylo worked tirelessly, tending to the forest&#8217;s vast network of mycelium.</p>



<p>Mylo&#8217;s daily routine was challenging, but essential. He massaged the mycelium, ensuring that the delicate fungal filaments remained strong and healthy. This intricate task required a gentle touch, patience, and an unwavering dedication to the forest&#8217;s wellbeing. As a mushroom nymph, Mylo was uniquely qualified for this critical job, as he could communicate with the mycelium and understand its needs.</p>

<p>Day after day, Mylo devoted himself to his work, taking pride in his role as the forest&#8217;s caretaker. The ancient trees and the vibrant, lush flora that filled the forest relied on the mycelium&#8217;s vast underground network to share nutrients, water, and essential information. Without Mylo&#8217;s tender care, the entire ecosystem could falter, and the enchanted forest would lose its magical essence.</p>



<p>But beneath Mylo&#8217;s steadfast commitment to his work lay a quiet sadness. While the forest and its inhabitants flourished under his care, Mylo couldn&#8217;t help but feel lonely. As the day turned to evening, he would look up from his work and watch the faeries dance, longing for companionship and understanding.</p>



<p>Mylo often wondered if he would ever find someone who could share in his love for the forest and appreciate the vital work he did. He yearned for someone who would understand the unique challenges of his life and the sacrifices he made to ensure the forest&#8217;s survival. As the sun dipped below the horizon and the fairy lights twinkled amidst the trees, Mylo couldn&#8217;t shake the loneliness that gnawed at his heart.</p>



<p>One evening, after a particularly exhausting day, Mylo decided to treat himself to a ground spruce burrito from his favorite stone taco wagon. The burrito vendor, nestled between ancient trees, was known for its delicious fare, including tacos, churros, and Mylo&#8217;s beloved burritos. As the friendly vendor handed over the scrumptious meal, Mylo&#8217;s eyes lit up, and he could hardly contain his excitement.</p>

<p>As he left the taco wagon, the aroma of the ground spruce burrito wafted through the air, momentarily lifting Mylo&#8217;s spirits. He couldn&#8217;t wait to savor the flavors that reminded him of the very essence of the forest he cherished. The anticipation of the first bite filled him with an unparalleled sense of joy and satisfaction. He knew that, even for a moment, the warm, hearty burrito would fill the void in his heart.</p>



<p>As Mylo wandered deeper into the enchanted forest, he approached a stream that he needed to cross. The air was filled with the calming sound of flowing water, and the stream sparkled in the fading twilight. Mylo, still clutching his prized ground spruce burrito, stepped onto the moss-covered stones that would guide him across the water. He felt a sense of accomplishment knowing that he had managed to acquire his favorite meal, and the anticipation of enjoying it brought a smile to his face.</p>



<p>However, as Mylo navigated the slippery stones, his excitement got the better of him. His foot slipped on the mossy surface, causing him to lose his balance. In that heart-stopping moment, the ground spruce burrito slipped from his grasp. Mylo desperately tried to catch the burrito before it met its watery fate, but his efforts were in vain. The burrito tumbled through the air, landing with a soft plop in the bubbling stream.</p>



<p>As the burrito floated downstream, Mylo&#8217;s eyes widened in disbelief, his heart aching with a sudden sense of loss. He frantically chased after the burrito, splashing through the stream in a comically tragic pursuit. The forest creatures stopped their playful activities to watch the mushroom nymph&#8217;s frantic efforts. Some of the faeries even giggled, finding amusement in the dramatic chase.</p>

<p>The ground spruce burrito, however, proved to be an elusive quarry. The stream&#8217;s gentle current carried it further away, just beyond Mylo&#8217;s reach. As the distance between him and his prized meal grew, the hope in Mylo&#8217;s heart began to fade. He realized that the burrito was slipping away from him, just like so many other things in his life.</p>



<p>Eventually, Mylo came to a halt, panting from his efforts. He stood there, soaked and defeated, as the ground spruce burrito disappeared from view. A feeling of deep sadness enveloped him, knowing that his delightful meal was now lost to the whims of the stream. And as the burrito floated further away, so too did the momentary happiness it had brought him.</p>



<p>Mylo&#8217;s heart ached with a mixture of sadness and fear as he stood by the stream, watching his ground spruce burrito drift further away. The emotions swirling within him were only intensified by the knowledge that he had a date with a beautiful amanita muscaria mushroom nymph later that evening. He had been looking forward to the date for weeks, hoping that perhaps he could finally find the companionship he longed for.</p>



<p>But now, with his stomach rumbling and his spirits low, Mylo couldn&#8217;t help but worry that he wouldn&#8217;t be his best self on the date. He knew that when he was hungry, he often became irritable and unfocused, and the last thing he wanted was to make a poor impression on the amanita nymph. The thought of losing this chance at love only intensified his feelings of loneliness, which had been growing steadily for years.</p>



<p>Mylo&#8217;s loneliness stemmed from the fact that he had always felt different from the other creatures of the mystical forest. While he had a few friends among the faeries and other magical beings, he knew that none of them could truly understand the burden of his work or the unique challenges he faced as a mushroom nymph. They could frolic and play all day, while he toiled away, caring for the mycelium and ensuring the forest&#8217;s well-being.</p>



<p>This loneliness was also rooted in Mylo&#8217;s belief that he would never find another nymph who shared his passion for the forest and its mycelium. He had heard tales of other mushroom nymphs who lived far away, but he had never encountered one in his own forest. As the years passed, Mylo couldn&#8217;t help but feel that his chances of finding true love were growing increasingly slim.</p>



<p>The loss of his ground spruce burrito seemed to symbolize all the disappointments and unfulfilled dreams that weighed on Mylo&#8217;s heart. He knew he needed to find a way to retrieve the burrito, not just to satiate his hunger, but to prove to himself that he could still find happiness despite his loneliness. With a deep breath, Mylo steeled his resolve and set out on his quest, determined to reclaim the burrito and perhaps, in the process, find the connection he so desperately craved.</p>



<p>With a heavy heart, Mylo continued his quest to retrieve his lost ground spruce burrito. As he wandered through the mystical forest, he stumbled upon a grizzled old potato nymph named Pato, who sat beneath a towering oak tree, humming a solemn tune. Pato&#8217;s appearance was striking – his skin was rough and textured, much like the bark of the ancient trees surrounding them, and his eyes gleamed with wisdom and experience.</p>

<p>Mylo hesitantly approached the old nymph and shared his tale of the lost burrito, hoping that Pato might have some advice on how to retrieve it. To his surprise, Pato&#8217;s face lit up as he listened to the story, and he revealed that he too had once lost a ground spruce burrito many years ago. Pato had since become a master at finding scrumptious lost foods, as he believed that no creature should be deprived of the joy that comes from savoring a delectable meal.</p>



<p>At first, Pato was reluctant to help Mylo, as he had grown accustomed to his solitary existence in the forest. However, as he observed the mushroom nymph&#8217;s determination and sadness, he found himself empathizing with Mylo&#8217;s loneliness. With a sigh, Pato agreed to help Mylo find his lost burrito, hoping that perhaps, in doing so, he could also help Mylo find the companionship he so desperately craved.</p>



<p>As they ventured deeper into the forest, Pato regaled Mylo with tales of his past adventures in tracking down lost foods, from enchanted acorns to bewitched berries. The duo formed an unlikely bond, with Pato teaching Mylo the skills necessary to recover his beloved burrito. Mylo listened intently to the old potato nymph&#8217;s wisdom, grateful for both the guidance and the newfound friendship.</p>



<p>Together, Mylo and Pato searched the mystical forest, following the stream&#8217;s winding path and using their combined knowledge to track the ground spruce burrito. Along the way, they encountered various magical creatures who offered advice and assistance, further strengthening Mylo&#8217;s connection to the enchanted forest and its inhabitants. And while Mylo&#8217;s heart still ached with loneliness, he began to feel a glimmer of hope that he might soon retrieve his burrito and, with it, the happiness and companionship he longed for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="953" height="1024" src="https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FA748206-A703-4DA0-991A-E56FD0500153-953x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5739" srcset="https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FA748206-A703-4DA0-991A-E56FD0500153-953x1024.png 953w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FA748206-A703-4DA0-991A-E56FD0500153-279x300.png 279w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FA748206-A703-4DA0-991A-E56FD0500153-768x825.png 768w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FA748206-A703-4DA0-991A-E56FD0500153-1430x1536.png 1430w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FA748206-A703-4DA0-991A-E56FD0500153-1320x1418.png 1320w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FA748206-A703-4DA0-991A-E56FD0500153.png 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 953px) 100vw, 953px" /></figure>



<p>Pato, sensing Mylo&#8217;s vulnerability, began to share his own experience with loneliness. He told Mylo that there was a time when he too felt isolated and disconnected from the world around him. The old potato nymph explained that he had eventually discovered that the key to overcoming his fear of loneliness was to recognize that it was an illusion, a fabrication of the mind that could be conquered by embracing self-love and opening oneself up to the connections that were waiting to be formed.</p>



<p>Pato advised Mylo to focus on the positive aspects of his life and to practice gratitude for the unique gifts he possessed. By acknowledging his own self-worth, Mylo would be better equipped to attract companions who valued him for who he truly was. Pato also explained that connections were formed not only through the sharing of joy but also through vulnerability and the courage to reveal one&#8217;s true self to others.</p>



<p>The wise old nymph suggested that Mylo should open his heart to the possibility of love and friendship, allowing himself to be receptive to the energies of those around him. Pato emphasized the importance of being present in the moment and engaging in meaningful interactions with others, as these were the building blocks of deep, lasting connections.</p>



<p>He went on to tell Mylo that, in the enchanted forest, he was never truly alone. The forest was filled with magical creatures, each with their own stories and struggles, and it was through the sharing of these experiences that they all became connected. Pato encouraged Mylo to reach out to others and to be willing to listen, learn, and grow through the shared wisdom of the forest&#8217;s inhabitants.</p>



<p>By sharing his own journey and offering this advice, Pato hoped to help Mylo understand that loneliness could be transformed into something beautiful and empowering. He wanted Mylo to see that the fear of loneliness, while valid, could be conquered by embracing self-love, gratitude, and the power of connection. It was in this spirit of transformation and growth that Pato believed Mylo would find the strength to face his fears and ultimately retrieve his lost ground spruce burrito.</p>



<p>Upon hearing Pato&#8217;s advice, Mylo took a moment to reflect on his fear of loneliness. He realized that this fear had been a constant companion throughout his life, manifesting itself in various ways. It was his loneliness that drove him to work so tirelessly on the mycelium, hoping that his dedication to the forest would somehow fill the void in his heart. And it was his loneliness that had caused him to become so attached to the ground spruce burrito, as it represented a small, fleeting moment of happiness in his otherwise isolated existence.</p>



<p>As Mylo contemplated his fear of loneliness, he began to see how it had played a role in the loss of his burrito. His longing for companionship and understanding had left him feeling vulnerable and distracted, which had ultimately led to his clumsy misstep on the moss-covered stones. He now understood that, in order to retrieve his burrito, he would need to confront his fear head-on and acknowledge the impact it had on his life.</p>



<p>Pato, recognizing the struggle within Mylo, offered his support and encouragement. He reminded Mylo that the enchanted forest was full of creatures who cared for him and that he was never truly alone. Pato also pointed out that, in their short time together, Mylo had already formed a bond with the grizzled old potato nymph, proving that he was capable of making meaningful connections.</p>



<p>Taking Pato&#8217;s words to heart, Mylo decided to face his fear of loneliness. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and imagined a world where he was surrounded by friends and loved ones, including the amanita muscaria mushroom nymph he had been eagerly anticipating meeting. In this vision, he saw himself happy and fulfilled, sharing the joys and challenges of his life with those who understood and appreciated him.</p>



<p>With newfound determination, Mylo opened his eyes and turned to Pato. He thanked the old nymph for his guidance and promised to carry the lessons he had learned with him on his quest for the ground spruce burrito. By acknowledging and confronting his fear of loneliness, Mylo felt a weight lift from his shoulders, and he sensed that he was now one step closer to retrieving his cherished burrito and finding the companionship he so desperately sought.</p>



<p>Mylo the mushroom nymph, guided by the wise old potato nymph, reached the fabled Pond of Reflection. The twinkling fairy lights illuminated the ancient trees around them, casting eerie shadows on the water&#8217;s surface. The potato nymph had shared the secret that Mylo&#8217;s fear of loneliness was the key to retrieving his lost spruce burrito, but Mylo couldn&#8217;t quite grasp how this was possible. The pond, while beautiful and mesmerizing, showed no signs of his precious burrito.</p>

<p>As they stood by the pond, the potato nymph began to explain the true nature of the challenge. &#8220;Mylo, the Pond of Reflection is a mystical body of water that reveals a person&#8217;s deepest fears, forcing them to confront and overcome them. In your case, your fear of loneliness is directly linked to the loss of your burrito, the very thing that brought us here. You must face your fear to save your burrito, and in doing so, you will realize that you are never truly alone.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mylo hesitated, feeling a tight knot of anxiety forming in his chest. He knew this was the moment of truth, the moment that would define his future. With a deep breath, he gathered his courage and stepped to the water&#8217;s edge. As he gazed into the Pond of Reflection, the water transformed into a mirror-like surface, showing Mylo an image of himself, completely alone in the mystical forest. The fear of loneliness gripped his heart, but he fought against it, reminding himself that he had people in his life who cared for him – the potato nymph, the faeries, and most importantly, the amanita muscaria mushroom nymph who was waiting for him.</p>



<p>As Mylo faced his fear head-on, the Pond of Reflection began to ripple and change. The image of his lonely self was replaced by a scene of the spruce burrito, precariously perched on a rock in the middle of the pond. The water around the rock began to churn, as if threatening to swallow the burrito whole. Mylo knew this was his chance to act. He leaped into the water, swimming with all his might toward the rock, determined not to let his fear of loneliness stop him from saving his treasured burrito.</p>



<p>The moment Mylo grasped the spruce burrito, the water calmed, and he felt a newfound sense of peace and self-assurance wash over him. He realized that he had finally conquered his fear of loneliness, and in doing so, had unlocked the power to save his burrito. With a triumphant smile, he swam back to the potato nymph, who was waiting on the shore with pride in his eyes.</p>



<p>As Mylo and the potato nymph turned to leave the Pond of Reflection, Mylo&#8217;s heart swelled with gratitude and joy. He knew that he was no longer alone, and that by overcoming his fears, he had become stronger and more capable than ever before. With renewed confidence and a spruce burrito firmly in hand, he was ready to face whatever challenges life had in store for him, knowing that he would never truly be alone again.</p>



<p>With the spruce burrito finally in his grasp, Mylo the mushroom nymph could hardly contain his joy. As he turned around triumphantly, a gentle rustling in the nearby bushes caught his attention. To his amazement, Amara, the amanita mushroom girl, emerged from her hiding place, her red and white cap glowing softly in the twilight. It seemed that she had been secretly observing Mylo and the grizzled old potato nymph throughout their journey, her curiosity piqued by their quest.</p>



<p>Mylo&#8217;s heart swelled with happiness at the sight of Amara, and he realized that it wasn&#8217;t just the retrieval of his beloved spruce burrito that had filled him with joy, but the connection he had formed with the potato nymph and the knowledge that Amara had been there all along, watching over him. He had faced his fear of loneliness head-on and discovered the strength and courage he possessed within himself.</p>



<p>Amara smiled warmly as Mylo approached her, the spruce burrito still clutched in his hand. &#8220;You did it, Mylo! You found your burrito and overcame your fear. I knew you had it in you.&#8221; She reached out a delicate hand to touch his arm gently, and Mylo felt a warm, tingling sensation spread throughout his body. He knew that he had found someone special in Amara.</p>

<p>Feeling more courageous than ever, Mylo decided to take a chance. He looked into Amara&#8217;s eyes and said, &#8220;You know, this adventure has taught me so much about myself, but it also made me realize that I don&#8217;t want to be alone anymore. I want to share my life with someone who understands me and my fears. Amara, would you share this spruce burrito with me and, perhaps, the rest of our lives together?&#8221;</p>



<p>Amara&#8217;s face lit up with a radiant smile, and she nodded her head enthusiastically. &#8220;I would be honored to share this burrito and our lives together, Mylo. There&#8217;s no one else I&#8217;d rather embark on this adventure with.&#8221; And so, under the enchanting canopy of the mystical forest and the twinkling fairy lights, Mylo and Amara sat by the crystal-clear pond, their wings shimmering, and shared the now legendary spruce burrito. In that moment, they knew that their lives were intertwined and that they would face the future together, hand in hand, conquering their fears and embracing the magic that the world had to offer.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>



<p>I recently found through MarketWatch (<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/adobes-20-billion-figma-merger-reportedly-facing-doj-scrutiny-2022-11-03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/adobes-20-billion-figma-merger-reportedly-facing-doj-scrutiny-2022-11-03</a>) that you are investigating the Adobe acquisition of Figma. I am glad to hear this and would like to provide my insight as both an Adobe and Figma customer, and why your investigation is important. In particular, as a dual citizen of both the United States and Canada, why this investigation is not only important to American citizens, but to creators all around the world.</p>



<p>My relationship with Adobe began in college where the company had a strong hold as an industry standard for creative learners and professionals in the digital space. My college chose the Adobe Creative Suite (now known as Creative Cloud) because of this. A side effect of this very common story across nearly all college campuses is that the cost of our education in both time and money, are heavily intertwined with Adobe&#8217;s products. At the time, I liked the software, and it did exactly what I needed to do. To this day, the ladder still holds true. However, over time, my use of these products began to become increasingly unacceptable to a professional like me for several reasons:</p>



<p>Disclaimer: I know these things are not illegal, but they are evidence to point for legitimate reasons for me to find a competitor.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Adobe uses what is called in the user experience design sector as, &#8220;dark patterns,&#8221; which can be a combination of deceptive design techniques intended to maximize the user to spend more money on the product at the expense of the software being more difficult to use in the process
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An example of these &#8220;dark patterns&#8221; is to make certain features that, on the surface, look like a great value-added part of their offerings, but are designed in such a way that the design makes the offerings prohibitively difficult and frustrating to use compared to virtually all other competitors. An example is Adobe&#8217;s cloud storage, where basic features like downloading multiple files (2 or more) is not possible when compared to similar services offered by Dropbox, Google, Microsoft, and others.<br><a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/creative-cloud-services-discussions/how-do-i-download-multiple-files-from-assets-adobe-com-web/m-p/12355771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://community.adobe.com/t5/creative-cloud-services-discussions/how-do-i-download-multiple-files-from-assets-adobe-com-web/m-p/12355771</a></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Adobe has designed their Creative Cloud software in such a way that it behaves exactly like malware. In other words, it <strong>is</strong> malware. I am not using hyperbole in this statement, I am using the literal definition of the word <em>malware</em>.<br><a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/creative-cloud-services-discussions/how-do-we-remove-this-malware-virus-called-quot-creative-cloud-quot/td-p/12232204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://community.adobe.com/t5/creative-cloud-services-discussions/how-do-we-remove-this-malware-virus-called-quot-creative-cloud-quot/td-p/12232204</a></li>



<li>Lastly, when I went through the appropriate channels to express my concerns/frustrations, it led to someone routinely insulting me – often in such a way that attempted to use my public disclosure of my disability against me. I reported this behavior 2 to 3 times to their moderation team and action has not been taken after over 2 months (thus far).</li>
</ol>



<p>As I say in my disclaimer, these 3 primary examples (of many) in my experience with Adobe has led to me finding other creative software to flee these constant disruptions in my workflow. This is where I decided to finally move on and began spending 3 months learning and using Figma, at which point I found out Adobe was acquiring Figma. Figma was known in the creative community as an Adobe alternative, with the more enthusiastic Figma fans calling it &#8216;the Adobe killer.&#8217; This narrative was often leveraged and promoted in the company&#8217;s marketing strategy. An example of this can be found in a deleted Tweet from its founder and CEO:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tweet has been deleted. <a href="https://t.co/mZUwRjJ7qo">pic.twitter.com/mZUwRjJ7qo</a></p>&mdash; Austin Byrd (@AustinTByrd) <a href="https://twitter.com/AustinTByrd/status/1570453693476253696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It is my opinion that Adobe&#8217;s acquisition of Figma is a clear case of anticompetitive behavior that puts people like myself and many other creatives in a position where </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>we stopped doing business with one company</li>



<li>that our strong distaste for that company led to us doing business elsewhere</li>



<li>find ourselves returning to that same company through said company acquiring its competitor</li>



<li>finding ourselves going to another company once more costly to us due to the time and money it takes to learn a new creative product</li>
</ol>



<p>Thank you for taking this time to read this and/or forwarding it to the appropriate individuals within the antri-trust division regarding this matter.</p>

<p>I continue to be fascinated by brands whose business model relies entirely on their&#8230; brand— branding!</p>



<p>In this casual rabbit hole, I was curious about Supreme. I thought of the idea of a parody using an antonym like &#8220;Inferior.&#8221; With a brand so widely known, I thought, &#8220;Surely this has already been done.&#8221; Indeed, it was.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="622" src="https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-11.30.45-AM-1024x622.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4355" srcset="https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-11.30.45-AM-1024x622.png 1024w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-11.30.45-AM-300x182.png 300w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-11.30.45-AM-768x467.png 768w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-11.30.45-AM-1320x802.png 1320w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-11.30.45-AM-600x364.png 600w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-12-at-11.30.45-AM.png 1508w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For reference, this is the Supreme Logo:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Supreme-Logo-1024x576.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4356" srcset="https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Supreme-Logo-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Supreme-Logo-300x169.webp 300w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Supreme-Logo-768x432.webp 768w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Supreme-Logo-600x338.webp 600w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Supreme-Logo.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Needless to say, the parody felt off. The kerning seemed to be non-existent, and the red box&#8217;s height is reduced because none of the letterforms have a descender. I personally didn&#8217;t like it. So I made my own attempt.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="775" height="300" src="https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/inferior.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4357" srcset="https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/inferior.png 775w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/inferior-300x116.png 300w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/inferior-768x297.png 768w, https://ianrandmckenzie.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/inferior-600x232.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /></figure>



<p>My only beef with my version is I couldn&#8217;t find the proper Futura font. It seems to be somewhere in-between medium italic and bold italic. But, as a meme/shitposting project, I don&#8217;t want to put any more time into it. I think I may get this printed and wear it just to make zoomers laugh. Here&#8217;s the PDF (vector format) if you want to print your own shirt:</p>
