<p>Old white women<br>The few, the proud<br>Defending us all when<br>There’s a hateful crowd</p>



<p>O, the venerable old white women<br>They like pleasant things<br>Sold with old white man’s acumen<br>A painting, a potting, a poem to sing</p>



<p>They fill up the galleries and boards,<br>the gardens, the place of their choice<br>They fill all the platforms in hoards<br>To give the voiceless a voice</p>



<p>With old white man money, shrewdness, power<br>We herald in now, the old white woman’s hour<br>To defend the down-trodden and sour<br>The beaten, battered, those without dower</p>



<p>I, too, am a white woman<br>For I’m not the villain<br>How could that be?<br>I defend against such villainy!</p>



<p>So step aside, savage<br>Coloured, queer, crazy, the rest<br>You should know now that I know the best</p>



<p>No one wants to be<br>The big bad guy<br>Or to shed resplendency<br>From things that we buy</p>



<p>So instead of admit<br>We do evil shit<br>Ourselves, we&#8217;ll acquit<br>Say I&#8217;m complicit?<br>HAH! Nuh-uh, we’ll <strong>buy</strong> it</p>



<p>Because when I put my manicured feet<br>On the chaos of the street<br>I cannot compete<br>With reality of defeat</p>



<p>Helped the worst off<br>But I exhale in a huff<br>They shoot themselves in the foot<br>‘They deserve where they’re put’</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I have to say<br>Because to my dismay<br>Lingering under my mental fray<br>My comforts made them this way</p>



<p>Those thoughts I can’t reconcile<br>To the idea I could I be so vile<br>So I ignore the trial of my amorality<br>And make pleasant things for inside a gallery</p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">Barkin' with my Rottie
Got Spot'y in my Bugatti
and I'm feelin' kinda naughty

Why?

'Cause the diamonds in — my hands
Are from blood in — the sands
Way off out in — far lands

Shit.

But I don't give two fucks
My daddy gave me 'mil bucks
Call it skill, hard work, and some luck

Aw, shucks.

I'm just a humble man with some quirks
Had thieves surround me with dirks
Behind me, my shadow lurks

Not my fault!

Fuck your blood
Drain it more, make red mud
With all my money, I will do good.

<pre class="wp-block-verse">Peter Piper picked a pickled pepper
from Pastor Perry's poverty provisions
the town prospered, yet lacked proper vision
leaving Peter in his precarity, resorting reliance on the rarity of charity
despite his capability to bring levity to his municipality's nobility
Peter ponders his predicament, preparing plans after some lament
So he brings his case to his party's base running their race
But they call Peter pompous and poor, a pilferer evermore
Purporting Peter's positing of his peering into the pool of perfection
Revealing racers' as ravagers, rapists, and raiders in their complexion of its reflection
Passing Peter's case as poor taste as they race to save face from perfections' mace

Peter Piper picked a pickled pepper
from Pastor Perry's poverty provisions
Humbled by our self-sabotaging divisions
A curious precarity of our fear bringing disparity
Our proclivity to pass powerful punches for brevity in accessibility of nobility
Peter pondered our predicament, a punitive prohibition of their privilege to lament
So we save face, sew sly safety in a sorrowful race
Kings who conquer caustic cowering claim purity preventing Peter's proscription to devour
They worked so hard, how dare Peter bard, pulling a card to show the shard
Of a soul sacked by salacious sabotage sewn by our own souls cracked
So we send some silver to Pastor Perry's poverty provisions

Absolving eyes blind to the perfect pool's vision of eternity's provision</pre>

 Some of these words are true<br />
Some of them are a lie<br />
Is the truth in my intent?<br />
Or in your mind's eye?<br />

I mean not to be terse<br />
But, what of the reverse?<br />
My truth spoken in humble verse<br />
For you to boast, harm, and curse?<br />

<pre class="wp-block-verse">Some of these words are true
Some of them are a lie
Is the truth in my intent?
Or in your mind's eye?

I mean not to be terse
But, what of the reverse?
My truth spoken in humble verse
For you to boast, harm, and curse?

Some of these words are true
Some of them are a lie
The truth is, frankly, up to you
Long after this speaker will die.</pre>

					<description><![CDATA[<br />
 Oversimplify<br />
De-contextualize<br />
Obfuscate<br />
See only with your eyes<br />
Blind them to nuance<br />
Text is not made by humans<br />
Get high on self-righteousness<br />
Believe you are sober<br />
<br />
Let your tongue be pulled by strings<br />
Volunteer your syrinx their song<br />
Grow evermore these cancerous things<br />
No one here thinks they're wrong<br />

<pre class="wp-block-verse">Who dare tame the river 
Or bleed the ocean blue
Who dare conquer shiver
Or claim what is true 

Who dare drink the waters 
And say it’s not for me
Who dare my life they shutter
And say it is not free

Who dare partition the past 
And build on top a lie
Who let this happen so fast?
Why, ‘twas no one but I. 

Who dare claim arcana
And say that I am wrong
When they possess no mana
Empty spells charged by throng

Who dare rebuke the deceiver
And deliver utterances of ‘god’
Who dare use word to deliver
When lexicon, constant, amounting fraud

Who let these conmen win
And gouge me with their fear?
Who dare proclaim I sin
When their sins fill my ear

Who dare claim the bed
When sand upon they rest
Their beach stained blood red
With order as their quest

Who dare lock this stone
While, too, shackle every womb
Who dare claim a throne
When all thrones turn tomb

Who dare scribe this ‘sage’
Upon this very page
When written from a cage
Locked by indignant rage</pre>

 Salt the earth<br />

Lock it in darkness for eternity<br />

Whether an hour or a year<br />
Tortured with entropy and fear<br />

Dank and dreary, dragging down<br />
Longing and waiting in endless drown<br />
Darkness reigns over with its resplendent crown<br />

Whether an hour or a year

Light will always be here

Dank and dreary, dragging down
Longing and waiting in endless drown
Darkness reigns over with its resplendent crown

Whether an hour or a year
Tortured with entropy and fear
Light will always be here

I will be the darkest of all
Bring down the monarch, rallying call
Return us to nothing, we must fall

Whether an hour or a year
Tortured with entropy and fear
Light will always be here

Millions of years felt so momentary
Shrinking and growing every eternity
I surrendered to myself and now the light is me

Whether an hour or a year
Tortured with entropy and fear
Light will always be here

Whether an hour or a year
Tortured with entropy and fear
Light will always be here</pre>

 If our blood was time<br />
Ticking, pumping, beat and chime<br />
Is your droplet a diamond or dime?<br />
<br />
As we watch it fly<br />
Every week, a litre goes by<br />
How soon before you would die?<br />
<br />
Precious minutes on roads,<br />
filled with your rage<br />
travelling alone to accelerated old age<br />
<br />
Listen to the vampire, guised as a sage?<br />
Build up his castle<br />
earning minimum wage?<br />

All around me [&#8230;]]]></description>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">If our blood was time
Ticking, pumping, beat and chime
Is your droplet a diamond or dime?

As we watch it fly
Every week, a litre goes by
How soon before you would die?

Precious minutes on roads,
filled with your rage
travelling alone to accelerated old age

Listen to the vampire, guised as a sage?
Build up his castle
earning minimum wage?

All around me I see and hear
Our time spent on money and fear
Who of us would outlast a year?

If your blood was time
Billionaires are bosses of crime
The corporate Tenochtitlan, most sublime

Like rivers flowing sanguine down the pyramid
Their HQ towers hemorrhage time in myriad
This is our invisible menstrual period

I will bloat and cramp no more
Shed for our cannibal chronovore
I bleed for life evermore

 Cool as a cucumber<br />
Cruisin' 'round the cul-de-sac<br />
Lost my years picklin'<br />
I don't even want 'em back<br />
<br />
I've got<br />
<br />
Dill in my jar<br />
Brine to the bar<br />
Anise like a star<br />
Feelin' like a Tzar<br />
<br />
Go ahead<br />
<br />
Pop my roof<br />
Catch me aloof<br />
Turned a sleuth<br />
and found the truth<br />
<br />
See,<br />
<br />
I look out the jar no further<br />
Know I'm the pickle for the burger<br />
Kill, maim, or capture<br />
Already know [&#8230;]]]></description>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">Cool as a cucumber
Cruisin' 'round the cul-de-sac
Lost my years picklin'
I don't even want 'em back

I've got

Dill in my jar
Brine to the bar
Anise like a star
Feelin' like a Tzar

Go ahead

Pop my roof
Catch me aloof
Turned a sleuth
and found the truth

See,

I look out the jar no further
Know I'm the pickle for the burger
Kill, maim, or capture
Already know my rapture

I know

I can writhe in this water and salt
Scream that it's your fault
Succumb to our occultism
And submit to Botulism

Nah

I love my buns and beef
The human drawn from smokey reef
Wedge me on the side
Squeeze me on the fries

Q sauce on the left
Hunger soon bereft
Salad on the right
Bring me into the light</pre>
