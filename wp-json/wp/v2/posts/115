My college classmates knew me as being insanely productive at times. My best ideas find me late at night. I love the quiet of the calm, dark hours. At night, there are fewer disturbances to send <a href=\"https:\/\/ianrandmckenzie.com\/2018\/03\/19\/how-i-experience-delusions\/\">my paranoia or delusions<\/a> haywire. Sometimes, I love the night a little too much. I had to find ways for how to manage relentless waking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is so much allure to staying up late, and, for me, staying up late almost always runs the risk of staying up all night. My love\/hate relationship with going to sleep has been ongoing for several years now. It began over a decade ago when I started taking Zyprexa (aka Olanzapine) to treat my schizophrenia. This medication had horrific sedation effects that rendered me a zombie most days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Zyprexa, I could sleep up to 24 hours straight if I didn&#8217;t set the alarm to wake me up. I was sleeping so much that I was missing out on a massive chunk of my life. Over time, I began to compensate for this lost time by staying awake for 24 hours straight. Sleep for 24, wake for 24. I regained some of my lost time, and it didn&#8217;t feel hard on me because of how much sleep I was getting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later on in life, I switched to taking Risperidone to treat my schizophrenia, and my sedation issues were drastically reduced. All of a sudden, I was able to wake up after sleeping 8 hours with a lot less struggle (though still a significant battle, I would often sleep for 10-12 hours at a time). Though my lost time had been regained, old habits failed to compensate. I would still stay up for 24 hours straight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I enter my 30s, staying up late and staying up all night is beginning to take its toll. If I stay up all night, I end my day in agony. The more I do it, the more painful it is. Even staying up late is problematic to my professional life. When I stay up late, I often do it ignoring meetings I have the following day. It hurts my professional appearance and shakes my confidence in myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, I&#8217;ve found myself wanting to stay awake when I am in a heightened state of excitement or anxiety. Right now, I am living paycheque to paycheque, and not knowing if I can keep up with my credit card payments is a continual stressor. I have recently concluded that I need to manage this anxiety and excitement. I also have to prepare for the moments where I can&#8217;t help myself and stay up late anyway. When learning how to manage relentless waking, it&#8217;s not necessarily about stopping it. You may just have to settle for mitigating its damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My playbook for how to manage relentless waking<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do Tomorrow&#8217;s Work Tonight<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to my field of work, I can bring my work home with me. When I have those moments of an uncontrollable urge to stay up late, I spend that wakeful energy on doing the work that needs to get done the next day so that when I finally wind down, I can sleep for as long as I need to without getting behind on work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Consider\/Cancel Appointments Before Deciding to Stay Up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to stop me from staying up late is to double-check my calendar before deciding to stay up late. If I have a meeting the next day that will interfere with me sleeping in, I will usually force myself to bed. Sometimes the anxiety is too much, in which case I cancel the appointments via email. I really don&#8217;t feel great about it, but the anxiety needs to be dealt with, which leads me to the next management tool&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Journal About Why You&#8217;re Staying Up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>About 6 months ago, I discovered the wonders of journaling. It&#8217;s been an extremely powerful tool in self-discovery, self-reflection, life planning, and so much more. One of the best ways to get myself in a place to go to sleep is to journal why I&#8217;m staying up. When I make those journal entries, I often feel immediately tired after getting my frustrations out on paper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create Incentives To Go To Bed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been developing my own personal life game where I sort of turn aspects of my life into a system similar to a video game with tasks and rewards (think experience points in a roleplaying game). I give myself points for doing all sorts of things, including doing a daily sketch, completing a full day of work, calling my grandmother, etc. Because proper sleep is important, I also give myself extra points for going to bed on time. If you&#8217;re not a gamer like me, you could reward yourself with something more tangible, like a cookie or extra TV time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thumbnail\/header photo by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@alexagorn?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\" target=\"_blank\">Photo Credit: Alexandra Gorn<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n Most people that know me are aware that I&#8217;m a night owl.
