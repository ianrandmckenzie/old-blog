Worse yet, setting mental illness and managing life aside, and you still can be overwhelmed with merely having what&#8217;s on your task list with business. Today was one of those days. My first reaction was to start cancelling non-critical meetings, stay late at the office, and try to brute force as much work completion as I could, all while being crushed by the feeling of being overwhelmed. In moments like this, it can be easy to forget how to manage overwhelming days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, my regular mindfulness practice eventually kicked in, and I had a revelation\u00a0on how I approach my challenge. I knew from past experiences and behaviors that working harder and longer is not the solution to a heavy workload. Heavy workloads can come and go, but some of them can last for months. When I work harder and longer for months at a time, my health upkeep may as well get flushed down the toilet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Counterintuitive&#8221; alert: Reduce your heavy workload, don&#8217;t increase it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So my solution has evolved from working harder and longer into a controversial alternative (controversial to me, at least). I decided that instead of my brute force tactic, I take another route. I decided to pick one to two critical things (today I picked two) that I could complete in a reasonable amount of time. Then, for the rest of the day, spend my time exclusively on self-care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic behind this is simple. I have a heavy workload now, and there is no indication of it relenting for the next few months. With this sudden recognition, I need to prepare my mind and body for hard work and challenges ahead. To maintain a constant flow of high productivity, I need to take care of the top three things that will enable that: proper diet, exercise, and time to unwind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, today, when I completed my two critical tasks, I completely dropped the subject of work from my mind. I made myself a healthy dinner and did some at-home lifting (<a href=\"https:\/\/ianrandmckenzie.com\/2018\/05\/17\/four-reasons-schizophrenic-men-should-be-bodybuilders\/\">did you know that weight lifting has amazing effects on schizophrenic men?<\/a>) and stretches. To unwind, and I did a couple of drawing and writing prompts. My high stress levels plummeted. I was able to think about the tasks ahead with a clear mind, and I&#8217;m moving into the rest of the week with confidence and less panic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thumbnail\/header photo by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@mbrunacr?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\">Photo Credit: Miguel Bruna<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n Managing life, business, and schizophrenia all at once can be incredibly overwhelming.
