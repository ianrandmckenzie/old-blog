Look at things objectively and without judgment. This is the best way for how to manage disturbing thoughts. It started when I began reflecting on why I was having suicidal thoughts. For an extended period, I would experience suicide ideation several times a day. Despite almost ten years of this happening, there was never a single time that I planned or attempted suicide. There seemed to be a distinct line drawn between thought and action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never planned or attempted suicide because, despite the endless barrage of thoughts about it, my life was okay.&nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t anything to brag about, but I was mostly content. This realization helped me&nbsp;recognize that there is a detachment from sane and insane thinking. Sane thoughts are products of who I truly am. Insane thoughts are products of what I fear most in humanity, personified by my voice. Suicidal thoughts were prevalent likely because the most likely person to kill me is&nbsp;myself \u2014 and I don&#8217;t want to die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second biggest fear I have outside of the safety of myself is the safety of my loved ones and people in general. As a result, another type of disturbing thought I get is flashes of hurting others. Much like not wanting to kill myself, I have no reason or desire to hurt others. But, the thoughts happen just the same. I spent ten years having suicidal thoughts and never once planned or attempted to kill myself. Knowing this has made thoughts of hurting others much more manageable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">These thoughts are not a reflection of who you are as a person<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently began talking to another person experiencing psychotic symptoms, and I liked the advice that I gave them:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><em>If I could give any advice, I&#8217;d say don&#8217;t let the thoughts you get be judgments on yourself. They are not who you are. They are just waking nightmares of what some people are, almost a hallucination of you in their shoes. It&#8217;s almost a kind of insight. You can now see more clearly what humanity is capable of, and how easy it can happen. It&#8217;s quite disturbing, and a big reason why I can get extremely polarized by things.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Having psychosis indeed can be an insight into the horrors of which humans are capable of carrying out. <a href=\"https:\/\/ianrandmckenzie.com\/2018\/03\/19\/how-i-experience-delusions\/\">These horrors can manifest themselves in paranoia and delusions (which I describe in this post).<\/a> I have seen in so many schizophrenic people their desire to protect others. They are fanatically passionate about protecting not just their loved ones, but humanity as a whole. On the rare occasions that schizophrenic people become violent, it is my opinion that they are acting out aggression on those that they see as a threat to humanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we are assaulted with nightmarish thoughts, thoughts that are not our own but are implanted within the context of our daily lives, we know that with a figurative flick of a switch, anyone can go from an average person to abhorrently evil. It fuels our paranoia and distrust, distracts us endlessly in our daily lives, and keeps us awake all night. When I draw the line between thoughts and actions, I am engaging in a daily act of trusting myself and trusting humanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thumbnail\/header photo by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@oscartothekeys?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\" target=\"_blank\">Photo Credit: Oscar Keys<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n One of the most significant breakthroughs I had when experiencing disturbing thoughts was to recognize that these thoughts are a product of psychosis and not that of my mind.
