I decided that I was going to read and internalize that list every single morning until they had become a part of me again. It took a lot of trial and error to find any success. This post is a loose timeline of how things went.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Month One<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I compiled the list and began reading it every day. The list consisted of almost 30 different things I wanted to be or to integrate into my life. I read it to myself in my head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Month Two<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After not much happening, I thought maybe the list was too big. I trimmed things down to about 10 items on my list. I continued to read the list to myself in my head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Month Three<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, nothing seemed to be integrating into my life. Out of exasperation, I reduced my list to just one thing. Again, I read it to myself in my head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Month Four<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing to read the 1 thing in my head, I was still not seeing much success. I began switching the 1 thing to other things that were on previous lists. Still, I read the items in my head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Month Five<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I began bouncing back and forth between various attempted versions of the prior months. Nothing was working, and I couldn&#8217;t figure out why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Month Six: The Breakthrough<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, I tried something new. I decided to increase the list to seven items. But, instead of reading them silently in my head. I read them out loud. It was extremely uncomfortable to do that, even though I would do it alone in my office. For the next two weeks, I pushed through my discomfort and continued to read them out loud. At this point, I realized I was doing something that has already been established \u2014 the act of practicing daily affirmations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what my list was:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>I will reject fear-mongering including my own<\/li><li>I will ignore whiners<\/li><li>I will embrace the present<\/li><li>I will show interest in people and ask questions<\/li><li>I will listen to and see people<\/li><li>I will give genuine compliments<\/li><li>I will give honest and sincere appreciation<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Within a few days, I was already noticing the effects of saying the list out loud. I was beginning to be more present in the moment, especially when in conversation with others. I was more easily able to listen and stop myself from interrupting people. I began asking way more questions than I had in months. I was able to maintain eye contact more often without making myself uncomfortable. I more liberally gave compliments (and yes, they were genuine!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, I hope to do another experiment: Saying these daily affirmations&nbsp;<strong>out loud to another person.&nbsp;<\/strong>My hunch that saying them out loud to myself would increase the impact. I can only assume saying them to another person can create a profound subconscious level of accountability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will say, if I hadn&#8217;t stumbled on practicing the act of daily affirmations on my own, I never would have done it. There is a certain culture and level of &#8220;hoo-ha&#8221; attached to this practice that is, frankly, offputting. But, I am 100% certain that it works. So, if you&#8217;re like me and suffer a degree of toxic masculinity, try and take my word for it. Get over yourself, ignore the poofs, and try out daily affirmations. I think you&#8217;ll&nbsp;be impressed with the results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@frozen_warmth?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\" target=\"_blank\">Photo Credit: William Farlow<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n About 6 months&nbsp;ago, I compiled a list of personal attributes I had in prior years, but for some reason had lost.
