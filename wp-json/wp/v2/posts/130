My symptoms were influenced by emerging forms of media on the internet that gave a voice to the unheard. Some of these unheard should remain unheard, but I listened to them, anyway. Pioneers in fear-mongering like Alex Jones, I believed everything they said. I didn&#8217;t have to listen much, YouTube and other recommendation engines were happy to place in front of my attention these alternative sources of (what I now know as false) information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It only took 5 to 10 views of this media before my paranoia and delusions did the rest of the work. I began stockpiling non-perishable food, first aid supplies, and water for myself. I also stockpiled candy, alcohol, and cigarettes that I would use for trade in the event of my imaginary apocalypse. Sometime after my recovery from these particular symptoms, my family and I called it &#8220;Ian&#8217;s apocalypse stash.&#8221; Thankfully, my apocalypse stash didn&#8217;t go to waste, we eventually made good use of all the items in my apocalypse stash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the act of stockpiling is not a fun experience. It gives a voice to the little voices in your head that assume the worst in humanity. It validates your unwarranted fears, legitimizes them, and in a way, makes you complicit in an act of selfishness in looking out for yourself, rather than contributing to helping others for the betterment of society. What if I had spent all that money and time on helping others? What if we all did that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I often quote The Humbling River by Puscifer because it resonates so much with me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Nature, nurture, heaven, and home<br>Sum of all, and by them, driven<br>To conquer every mountain shown<br>But I&#8217;ve never crossed the river<\/p><p>Braved the forests, braved the stone<br>Braved the icy winds and fire<br>Braved and beat them on my own<br>Yet I&#8217;m helpless by the river<\/p><p>&#8230;<\/p><p>Pay no mind to the battles you&#8217;ve won<br>It&#8217;ll take a lot more than rage and muscle<br>Open your heart and hands, my son<br>Or you&#8217;ll never make it over the river<\/p><p>It&#8217;ll take a lot more than words and guns<br>A whole lot more than riches and muscle<br>The hands of the many must join as one<br>And together we&#8217;ll cross the river<\/p><p>&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We can stockpile all we want, look out for #1, prepare for a disaster and whatever else. But, if your stockpiling is seeking to ensure survival for longer than 6 months, you are giving in to your fears. Our generation faces many challenges, and if you&#8217;re spending your time and efforts hedging your bets on yourself long-term, we all lose. An individual cannot survive a human extinction event. It is a challenge that must be taken on together in unity while we still have the resources to come out ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I see people panic buying in stores, I don&#8217;t see sane, rational thinking. I see fear. I see myself ten years ago. If you want to survive a pandemic, think less about yourself and more about how you can help others. That is how we cross the river.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@borisdunand?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Boris Dunand<\/a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/empty-store-shelves?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n Almost ten years ago, my symptoms controlled my thoughts.
