As entrepreneurs, it can consume our lives and severely damage our relationships with our friends and family. I am a little over a year into this journey, and I can already see the effects of work-life taking over. I have been developing my tools for creating a healthy work-life balance. In that development, I&#8217;ve sought out the wisdom of other people in my position. Why reinvent the wheel? I am a software developer, after all!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my search for the wisdom of others, I found a lot of articles that don&#8217;t quite get into the nitty-gritty of time management, particularly in the context of software development. A substantial challenge is working as the sole employee (or co-employee) of a company performing tasks ranging from full stack development, graphic design, marketing, research, and so on. To be a jack of all trades, working 5+ roles and still manage to meet self-imposed deadlines as quickly as possible. As an entrepreneur, it feels like everything needs to be done all at once, and that can create a lot of stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meet&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/tickit.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tickit<\/a>&nbsp;co-founder Alex Dunae (&nbsp;). Alex has been a developer and entrepreneur in Comox Valley for over ten years. I&#8217;ve been scouring the internet for the wisdom of entrepreneurs in my situation, and it turns out I only had to walk a few blocks from my house! I sat down with Alex at the Union Street Grotto in Courtenay and asked, in a few different ways, how he manages his time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not record our conversation, and I&#8217;ve already wasted enough of your time with the introduction, so here&#8217;s a summary of his answers to each of my questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">As a father, business partner, entrepreneur, boyfriend, and someone who has to take showers and eat, how do you divide up your week?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Four days\/week dedicated to the kids with 4 to 6 hours at night assigned to work.<\/li><li>Three days\/week devoted to work. These days are where the bulk of things happen.<\/li><li>Around 55 hours per week of week total work, with about 5 hours per week with his business partner, hanging out and talking shop.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do you tackle tasks that you know will take more than a couple of hours?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(This answer is in the context of software development)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Create an issue on your version control platform of choice<\/li><li>Let the significant change\/feature percolate for a few days\/weeks<\/li><li>Justify why the change\/feature is necessary. Find where you messed up. Be critical of its need \u2013 try to shoot it down.<\/li><li>Write pseudo-code \u2013 this will sate your trigger-happy coding fingers and give you a better idea of how to tackle the solution.<\/li><li>Think about how your program will interact with this feature. What is your ideal API? Continue to percolate.<\/li><li>Wait for components to reveal themselves. Find flaws in the logic.<\/li><li>Think about what may be affected by the change. What kind of work is involved in addressing that? Start laying the groundwork for those components.<\/li><li>Implement!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do you set deadlines for yourself?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Priority-based with the following on a scale of 1 to 5:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Customer demand<\/li><li>Difficulty<\/li><li>Customer pains<\/li><li>Customer gains<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What are customer pains\/gains? Read about&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/strategyzer.com\/books\/value-proposition-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">value proposition design here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This priority system is trumped by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Major bug fixes<\/li><li>A customer needs a specific feature (this is more applicable to the kind of app Alex is working on)<\/li><li>Preparing for crunch times (Again, specific to Tickit, which relies on seasonal traffic)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much time per week do you spend on interaction with your customers?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A minimum of 8 hours per week<\/li><li>Because of the nature of Tickit, there are about three weeks spent with in-person meetings with clients, on-site.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do you know when to prioritize coding vs. behind the scenes work like research?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>When you don&#8217;t know how to do something (Needs driven \u2013 know when it&#8217;s time to learn and when it&#8217;s time to work)<\/li><li>When you feel like technology is leaving you behind, it&#8217;s time for professional development<\/li><li>At least twice a year, spend time on marketing position (research), this leads to ideas for new features<\/li><li>When wanting to code a new feature, remember that percolating is necessary! Actively push off coding. Write pseudo-code if you need to be sated. Spend days\/weeks\/months developing your idea before you code it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you learned about your journey that you feel is worth sharing?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex jokingly replied to this, &#8220;Nothing!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He contorted for over 30 minutes trying to answer this question in an attempt to come up with a profound answer, but I think his joke is profound enough. I&#8217;m going to close with a few words on the assumption that it is true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet is riddled with blogs glamourizing entrepreneurship, boasting a lifestyle and work ethic that is suited to very few people. Even for the people that it is suited to, it is still a tremendous challenge, and at the end of the day, the journey is not all that glamorous or worth sharing. It&#8217;s about working your ass off trying to get rich (or at least make a comfortable living and the ability to retire at a reasonable age) while attempting to create value where there was none before. This lifestyle is for us, entrepreneurs, people who are relentlessly obsessive. It&#8217;s in our nature to chase the white whale, and it&#8217;s important that we are careful about how fervently we pursue it. I hope these not-so-glamorous tidbits of information can help myself and other entrepreneurs tweak our schedules in a way that makes us more careful, and overall, healthier. For me, I think they will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thumbnail Photo by<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@urosjovicic96?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uro\u0161 Jovi\u010di\u0107<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n Working as an entrepreneur in any industry can be a monstrous life-sucker.
