For some of you, you may be terrified and confused. For others, like me, you were relieved by finally knowing what you&#8217;ve been living through. One thing is for sure: you&#8217;re wondering what to do next. Don&#8217;t panic! I&#8217;ve been where you&#8217;re at right now, and guess what? Schizophrenia is an afterthought for me most days. I have a job that I love and am successful at, I live with my beloved and supportive partner and I support her as well, I have hobbies (Minecraft, anyone?), I stay in touch with my family (mostly teaching my niece and nephew naughty words so I can be the &#8216;cool&#8217; uncle), and I live most days unimpeded by my psychotic symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Join me as I reveal my personal playbook for conquering schizophrenia<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this Diagnosis to Success series, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hjMti1f-jOU&amp;list=PLh5EZR6XAIdo8m593dMR6WV7ebg7GurvH&amp;ab_channel=ianrandmckenzie\">I&#8217;m making YouTube videos that outline my playbook for conquering schizophrenia every single day<\/a>. In these blogs, the videos&#8217; sister content, I will go into more detail and include as many additional resources as I can think of. Each piece of content will give you actionable things you can do to make sure you stay healthy and avoid psychotic episodes as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not some snake oil salesman, by the way. I have lived with schizophrenia for 21 years, and 4 months from now marks the 10th anniversary of living 10 years without having a single psychotic episode. How did I manage to do that? By doing the things I outline in my videos and blogs. I don&#8217;t do all the things all at once, in fact, I often neglect to do many of the things I teach on any day-to-day. There is no silver bullet to slaying schizophrenia every day, but if you do enough of these things, <strong>living with schizophrenia and having a normal life or two things that can coexist.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You&#8217;re not alone!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of online communities, and they are full of amazingly supportive people who are living through the same schizophrenia symptoms you are. Check out Reddit (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/schizophrenia\">see \/r\/schizophrenia<\/a>) or Facebook (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1333502833345108\">see Schizophrenia Facebook Group<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, there&#8217;s no need to panic. Living with schizophrenia is like having an obnoxious family member. They&#8217;re not going anywhere, so you just have to manage the oddities and quirks as they come. They&#8217;re with you for life, so the best thing to do is find the best ways to live a harmonious life with them. In these videos and blogs, I&#8217;ve done the heavy lifting for you. I know the best ways to manage schizophrenia on a day-to-day basis and it starts with knowing that having it is not the end of the world. So, if you believe me, you&#8217;re already one step closer.
