In some ways, it was a very frightening time. I knew I could no longer trust reality as I perceive it. I began to question everything that I was perceiving. What is real? What isn&#8217;t real? How do I tell the difference? As a natural progression from that questioning, I was forced to become analytical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The better you become at analyzing and explaining what is real, the easier it is for you to identify what isn&#8217;t real. Picture this: a virus spreading all over the globe, a United States president inciting an insurrection, and images of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bernie_Sanders_mittens_meme\">a man wearing mittens being spammed all over the internet<\/a>. The real world can be a pretty fucking bizarre place. But, when you dig deep enough, everything has a logical, fact-based explanation. Let&#8217;s say you start thinking aliens are invading Australia, for example. Then, you can&#8217;t find any verifiable, reputable sources to back up such an idea. It may be a good idea to check in on whether you may be having a delusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The real world is a scary place<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ianrandmckenzie.com\/2018\/03\/19\/how-i-experience-delusions\/\">As you may already know from this post, I have some undeniably bonkers ideas pop in my head.<\/a> Those bonkers thoughts, however, are a drop in the bucket compared to the real things that have happened in this world that have been equally horrifying. As an example, I read a very official-looking news article that was reporting on a zombie virus spreading on the East Coast of the United States. After about an hour-long process of having a panic attack and then finally calming down, further research led me to find that I was on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theonion.com\/\">a parody news site like The Onion<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more difficult to grapple with are pieces of news that can&#8217;t be explained away with parody. Things like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anwar_al-Awlaki#:~:text=Al%2DAwlaki%20became%20the%20first,U.S.%20citizen%20without%20a%20trial.\">President Obama giving the green light on the assassination of a U.S. citizen<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani\">President Trump assassinating an Iranian general that could have led to another war in the Middle East<\/a>. Both frightening cases of abuse of executive power, and very real things that are hard to ignore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When being analytical is not enough<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With instances like the examples above, it can be hard not to go into full-on panic mode. The best you can do is say to yourself, &#8220;It&#8217;s not my problem.&#8221; The more you do it, the more it will help ease the fright. Realistically, the statement will almost always be true. It&#8217;s not your problem. Are you a US General? No? Then it&#8217;s not your problem. Are you involved in military activity in the Middle East? No? Not your problem. Are you politician managing affairs in the Middle East? No? <strong>Say it with me!<\/strong> <strong>Not. My. Problem.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n Diagnosis to Success Part 5 <\/p>\n<p> When I was 16, I was diagnosed with prodromal schizophrenia.
