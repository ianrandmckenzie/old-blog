First and foremost, medication is the best treatment for psychosis. If you are not taking your medication, you&#8217;re doing it wrong. This post is about what I know as the best <strong>supplementary<\/strong> treatment for psychosis. What might that be, you ask? A low-carbohydrate diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned in my previous post, <a href=\"https:\/\/ianrandmckenzie.com\/2018\/05\/17\/four-reasons-schizophrenic-men-should-be-bodybuilders\/\">4 Reasons Schizophrenic Men Should Be Bodybuilders<\/a>, low-carbohydrate diets have multiple health benefits for psychosis that isn&#8217;t just about reducing symptoms. For all you skeptics, that post also provides links to scientific papers to back up my claims. Despite its benefits, it can be a completely useless remedy if you can&#8217;t stick to it long-term. That&#8217;s why, to me, the best treatment is a <strong>low-carb<\/strong> diet, not a no-carb, zero-carb, or ketogenic diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Low-carb, not no-carb<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality of <strong>any<\/strong> diet is that it needs to be something that can be realistically adhered to <strong>for the rest of your life<\/strong>. I know from personal experience the futility of sticking to an activity that is heavily tied to willpower (<a href=\"https:\/\/fox17.com\/news\/local\/researchers-find-willpower-not-enough-to-achieve-goals-self-control-offer-solutions\">a human trait that is fleeting at best<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve gotta be completely honest here. I <strong>love<\/strong> carbs. Some buttered toast, a cookie, an unfiltered wheat ale. I can&#8217;t get enough of it. If I went on a zero carb diet, sure, it might be physically helping me. However, a huge part of me would die inside. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;but wait, what&#8217;s this? I hear a voice. Do you hear it, too?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just not taking your health seriously. You aren&#8217;t trying hard enough to manage your health.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh look, it&#8217;s try-hard Tommy telling me I&#8217;m not good enough. You know what? Fuck you, Tommy. When it comes to mental health, having realistic expectations of yourself is just as necessary as sticking to a healthy diet. Are you <strong>really<\/strong> going to <em>realistically<\/em> cut out all carbohydrates from your diet? If you can, wonderful! Do it, and do it now. But for little carb-gobbling monsters like me, a heavy dose of pragmatism is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Treatment for psychosis will always have pragmatism in its ingredients<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every day, we are presented with multiple forks in the road. Do I eat a salad with no croutons, or do I have that sandwich with the big, bready bun? Do I have sugar in my coffee, or just settle for cream? At the end of the day, if you&#8217;re saying &#8220;no&#8221; 80% of the time to those opportunities of having carb-heavy foods like wheat, sugar, corn, rice, and potatoes, you&#8217;re doing swimmingly. When you can say no 80% of the time, that 20% of &#8216;chip dinners&#8217; and 2 pints with the boys isn&#8217;t a moment of weakness, it&#8217;s a conscious, healthy choice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n Diagnosis to Success Part 7 <\/p>\n<p> I feel that it&#8217;s appropriate with this post to say a few things upfront.
