It started with a change in medication, then a low carbohydrate diet. That evolved into exercising, and, to a degree, bodybuilding. Bodybuilders typically adhere to a high fat, low carbohydrate diet. They do weight training and exercising to tune their body to that of a Greek statue sculpted from marble. This post will list the 4 reasons why this lifestyle is perfect for non-aggressive males with schizophrenia. Long story short, schizophrenic men should be bodybuilders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. A low carbohydrate diet reduces symptoms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies from years ago and even more recently are concluding that excessive carbohydrate consumption increases the frequency and intensity of symptoms. Thus, this means the need for cutting out foods like sugar, bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and corn. (1)(2)(3)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. A low carbohydrate diet reduces the likelihood of diabetes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many antipsychotic medications have side effects that cause a substantial gain in weight, typically due to increased appetite. The weight gain can be so severe, that it can result in diabetes. Low carbohydrate diets reduce appetite and shed excess weight. Remarkably, this counteracts the damaging weight gain side effects from antipsychotic medication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Increased testosterone levels from weightlifting reduce negative symptoms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have concluded that increased testosterone levels in non-aggressive schizophrenic males reduce negative symptoms (4). Weight training increases your testosterone levels naturally. As a result, this makes it a great way to rid one\u2019s self of negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are often treatment-resistant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. A better-looking body boosts confidence and self-worth<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schizophrenic people are very often isolated. Sometimes intentionally, sometimes because we\u2019ve been hiding for so long we don\u2019t know how to talk to people. Subsequently, with increased confidence and self-worth, we can attempt social interaction. When we know we look good and are healthy, we feel like we&#8217;re on the right track to becoming normal again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Schizophrenic men should be bodybuilders, but sticking to that lifestyle can be difficult<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sticking to a low-carbohydrate diet can be tricky. Especially when so much of our society is built around high-carbohydrate foods. Every so often, I find myself straying from this diet. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/ianrandmckenzie.com\/2019\/04\/29\/rediscovering-my-low-carbohydrate-diet\/\">I always come back, as I describe in this post.<\/a> I&#8217;m always looking for new ways to perfect this practice.
