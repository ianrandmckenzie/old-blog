Out of all hallucinations that exist, the most prevalent symptom is hearing voices. When I hear voices, I generally hear them as a cacophony of whispers. Occasionally, a loud voice will shout amongst the whispers that will sort of jolt me back into reality. After that loud voice shouts, the whispers will go away for a while. Hearing voices becomes most noticeable when I&#8217;m going to bed. I think this is because there aren&#8217;t real noises or thoughts to distract me from the whispers I would have normally heard throughout the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can rarely discern what the voices are saying. The only time I can make out what is being said is when one of the voices shout. Although, when the shouting happens, 80% of the time or more they&#8217;re just yelling my name. The most common shouting voice I hear is in my grandfather&#8217;s voice. In reality, my grandfather never yells. I&#8217;ve never once heard him raise his voice, let alone show any sort of hostility. I&#8217;ve never viewed my grandfather in a negative light. I think that when I hear his voice, maybe hearing it calms my nerves. It sort of relieves stress which subsides the other voices. It seems my grandparents have always been a positive part of my life, even when I&#8217;m hallucinating their presence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hallucinations bring out negative feelings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s actually quite rare for hallucinations to be positive. As a Tourette\u2019s syndrome sufferer only yells expletives instead of compliments, a schizophrenic person typically has hallucinations and delusions that are unsettling in some way or another (<a href=\"https:\/\/ianrandmckenzie.com\/2018\/03\/19\/how-i-experience-delusions\/\">I describe what having delusions is like in this post &#8211; click here<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of voices, I&#8217;ve had plenty of other hallucinations. My most common hallucinations are through smell and taste but mostly smell. I will often smell smoke which will feed a delusion that the house is on fire. I often find myself systematically going through the house to make sure nothing is on fire. Sometimes it works out in my favor, however; another symptom of schizophrenia is inattentiveness. Sometimes I might forget to turn off the burner of the stove. I&#8217;ll find out soon after due to my paranoid delusions and hallucinations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hallucinations and delusions can go hand-in-hand<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as delusions of taste go, I often think that people are spiking my drinks (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Date_rape_drug\">an activity common in date rape crime<\/a>). It&#8217;s completely irrational, but the thoughts are there nonetheless. So if I&#8217;m getting a coffee from a coffee shop, sometimes I&#8217;ll taste liquor for the first sip until I sort of collect my thoughts and rationalize them away. Generally, once I make an effort to rationalize why I&#8217;m experiencing something like this, I can go on with my normal way of going about life. This is not just true with hallucinations, but most of any symptoms I have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the times that I have visual hallucinations, it&#8217;s sometimes extreme. The most common visual hallucination I had was when I was working at a liquor store. When you work at a liquor store you end up dealing with a lot of unsavory people, mostly alcoholics and shoplifters, or shoplifters that are alcoholics. Dealing with these people takes a toll on you mentally. You may not notice it, but it happens. I didn&#8217;t notice it, but the stress from it manifested in an increase of psychotic symptoms, one of them being visual hallucinations of nuclear bombs being detonated in the city I was living in. Again, like many of the symptoms I experience, I had to make a concerted effort to rationalize away these experiences.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n Hallucinations are hearing, seeing, tasting, feeling and smelling things that aren&#8217;t actually there.
