As a content creator, it&#8217;s important to stand out. To do this, I decided to say something that might be considered rude and unkind. It bothered me. I asked the AI to help me re-word the unkind parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OpenAI&#8217;s Response<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand your perspective on the concept of good and evil, but some of the language used in your blog post may be considered rude or unkind to some readers. Here are a few specific examples and suggestions for how to revise them:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You are fat, angry, ugly, lonely, and tired (FAULT).&#8221; This language is harsh and may be hurtful to some readers. Instead, you could say something like &#8220;Many people feel that they have negative qualities such as feeling overweight, angry, lonely, and tired. But, it&#8217;s important to remember that these feelings are not your fault.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Being evil is not your fault. But, evil is your FAULT.&#8221; This is contradictory and could be confusing to readers. Instead, you could say something like &#8220;Recognizing that the concept of good and evil is a lie can give us the freedom to let go of blame and guilt for our actions.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I somehow developed a physically sensed moral compass.&#8221; This could be perceived as boastful, and could come across as dismissive of others experiences. Instead, you could say something like &#8220;I noticed that I had a physical sensation in my scalp when I did something that my brain considered &#8216;good&#8217; or &#8216;evil&#8217;, this gave me a better understanding of my own actions.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most young white men in my position are at the whims of nurture over nature.&#8221; this statement may be considered offensive and dismissive of other people&#8217;s experiences. Instead, you could say something like &#8220;Many people&#8217;s experiences and perspectives can be shaped by their environment and societal influences.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The most heinously \u2018evil\u2019 people, in my mind&#8221; this statement may be considered dismissive of the suffering caused by those actions. Instead, you could say something like &#8220;The actions of certain individuals may cause immense harm and suffering to others, but it&#8217;s important to remember that their actions are not necessarily motivated by evil.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of search engine optimization, it&#8217;s important to include your keywords in the headings and subheadings, as well as throughout the post. You may also want to include some variations of your keywords, such as &#8220;good vs evil is a lie&#8221; or &#8220;is good and evil a lie&#8221; to capture different search queries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the post itself, it&#8217;s important to remember that the post is your own opinion and perspective, but it&#8217;s important to be mindful of how it may be received by others, and use language that is considerate and respectful towards all readers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n Introduction by Ian <\/p>\n<p> Recently, I wrote a blog post about how I believe the concept of good and evil is a lie.
