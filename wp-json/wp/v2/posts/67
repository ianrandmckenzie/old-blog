Recently, I&#8217;ve been experimenting with where I sleep in the house. Because I can&#8217;t be moving the bed all of the time, I&#8217;ve been sleeping in makeshift beds. I tried 3 different beds on the hardwood floor:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A blanket underneath me<\/li><li>A thin foam pad with a blanket over it<\/li><li>A camping thermarest with the foam pad on top, covered by a blanket<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Goldilocks Bed for Sedated People<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This turned out to be a bit of a Goldilocks story of how I get a restful sleep, but manage to wake up easier in the morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With just the blanket underneath, the hardwood floor was too harsh, and my hips and shoulders would get sore and make my sleep very unrestful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the camping thermarest and foam pad, the makeshift bed was too comfortable&#8230; I fell back into my old habits from sleeping in a bed and sleeping for 12+ hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the thin foam pad, it was comfortable enough to get a solid rest, yet uncomfortable enough that I wouldn&#8217;t want to stay in bed after my alarm starts going off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s interesting is, there have been days where I hit the snooze button over and over again, but generally when I do that and I&#8217;m in bed, I eventually give up and just turn the alarm off and go back to sleep. With the Goldilocks bed, I don&#8217;t give up and go back to sleep because the bed is uncomfortable enough that by the time I&#8217;m turning off my alarm completely, my body and mind is ready just enough to pull myself out of bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, there will inevitably be times where I&#8217;m going to oversleep regardless. In those moments, I do my best to manage my expectations. <a href=\"https:\/\/ianrandmckenzie.com\/2021\/01\/26\/chronic-schizophrenia-manage-your-expectations\/\">I explain managing expectations in more detail in this post.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thumbnail\/Header photo by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@entersge?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\" target=\"_blank\">Photo Credit: Vladislav Muslakov<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n For quite a while now, I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to manage medication sedation.
