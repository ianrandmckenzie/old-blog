In those 10 years, the only education-related thing I did was studied for my driver&#8217;s license. I failed the learner&#8217;s permit exam over 10 different times in two provinces and one state. When I started to master my ability to manage my schizophrenia, my ability to perform was sent through the roof. I started college for the first time in my life. In my first year, I was out-performing not only my past self but most of my classmates as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of that first year, my summer break didn&#8217;t mean my education ended. I was self-learning at such an accelerated pace that I would argue I learned more in my summer than I did in my first year. I began working on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ians.studio\/articles\/stridr-case-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stridr<\/a>, and my high productivity continued. I was quickly becoming accustomed to my ability to get a lot of things done in a short period of time with a great degree of quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in the fall of 2016, I contracted mononucleosis. It had me bed-ridden for almost two weeks. I got lucky that it wasn&#8217;t more than that, but it severely disrupted my health management flow. I stopped going to the gym as much. I was less disciplined sticking to my low-carbohydrate diet. For the following two-and-a-half years, my physical and mental health declined. As a result, so did my productivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a slow and gradual decline, barely noticeable. Because I didn&#8217;t notice it, I was under the delusion that I was just as productive as when I was in the summer of 2016. I was really hard on myself. The less productive I was, the more I would push myself. The more I would push myself, the more my health declined. I was only able to get myself out of it when I made a potentially disastrous life-changing decision as a result of my poor health and mindset. Thankfully, nothing bad happened. The wakeup call ended up turning my life around back in the right direction, and I am now able to recognize what happened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a high-functioning schizophrenic? Maybe you have another mental illness. Have you fallen into this productivity trap before? Please share your story in the comments. Let&#8217;s start a conversation about this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thumbnail\/header photo by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@picsbyjameslee?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\" target=\"_blank\">Photo Credit: James Lee<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n In the year 2015, I had been out of school for 10 years.
