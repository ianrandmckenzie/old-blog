I wanted to find new people and things to follow based on what I already like, without having to navigate all of these platforms blind. Every time I tried to find an \u2018all-in-one\u2019 social media app, I only found apps for social media managers, but nothing for the social media USERS. In this way, Stridr stands out from all the rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a brief walk-through of what Stridr is, followed by a description of the challenges faced from creating it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">All of your social feeds&nbsp;in one place.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Supported platforms include DeviantArt, Facebook, Pinterest, Reddit, Spotify, Tumblr, Twitch, Twitter, and YouTube.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/BcjveAr.png\" alt=\"\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/BcjveAr.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A hub for finding your favorite people across social media and to&nbsp;discover their interests.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Log in and sync your accounts to discover what you have in common with your friends and those you follow.

Some of the technical challenges include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>OAuth1 and OAuth2 authentication flow.<\/li><li>REST API Interaction<\/li><li>Asynchronous Tasks<\/li><li>In-memory data structure storing<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Unobstrusive JavaScript<\/li><li>REST API Development<\/li><li>React Native Development<\/li><li>Database design\/administration<\/li><li>Full Text Search development<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stridr&#8217;s initial interface was designed by&nbsp;Taylor Leach<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Stridr&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/stridr.social\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">minimum viable product<\/a>&nbsp;was developed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/taylorleach.me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taylor Leach<\/a>&nbsp;and I for our Portfolio Project class project at North Island College, spanning over an entire semester. While Taylor has since departed from the project, I continue to adhere to his professional quality designs. Stridr&#8217;s logo was designed by me, and all design implementations made best efforts to adhere to branding guidelines set out by the social platforms utilized. Additionally, Stridr&#8217;s Business Plan and Business Model Canvas brochure were designed and written as part of other class projects. Our tools\/methods for design include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Adobe CC (Ai, Ps, Id, Xd)<\/li><li>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, jQuery<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>UI\/UX Design<\/li><li>Branding<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stridr is operating under the principles of being&nbsp;lean with agile development&nbsp;and an imperative of&nbsp;designing value.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, the business plan, business model canvas, persona profiles, and value proposition canvas were created to establish a solid foundation for the product and its future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/RTBtjLe.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/RTBtjLe.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As of Jan. 2018, Stridr has been set aside indefinitely.
