Last week,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ians.studio\/articles\/how-i-use-google-keep-notes-to-organize-my-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I wrote about how I use Google Keep to organize my tasks and keep myself motivated<\/a>. These tasks are primarily activities and results driven, but over the last couple of weeks, I started to create tasks with &#8220;Start work on _____.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be real with ourselves here for a moment. Procrastination can be a problem for even the most successful and driven people. Unless you&#8217;re in a position like an emergency responder, procrastination can quickly take over your work. For me, procrastination is a huge cause of stress. The longer a task lingers, the more I can feel it eating away at me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to train your brain into doing something is positive reinforcement. If you&#8217;re on a rigid diet but love candy, reward yourself with a single Skittle. If you&#8217;re an entrepreneur like me starving for any indication that you&#8217;re making forward momentum, being able to tick the checkbox next to a task can give you that endorphin rush to keep you going.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">played MMORPGs for a massive chunk of my life<\/a>, my brain has been rigorously conditioned to chase those tiny little endorphin rushes. In these games, you would get it from killing a major boss, defeating your opponents in Player vs. Player combat, acquiring a piece of rare, high-value equipment. These small things that happen at seemingly random intervals create huge positive reinforcement that keeps you playing the game day after day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, my endorphin rushes are now completing tasks, getting a prospect to ask for a demo or proposal, making a sale, having a great conversation with a prospect, being able to meet with my advisor and accountability buddy and telling them I accomplished my goals for the weeks. Being able to get this same reward for starting something that I could potentially procrastinate on has been a fantastic way to keep me focused on priorities and making forward momentum with my business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\n As entrepreneurs, all too often, we get fixated on activity goals and results goals.
